        <p class="project-text"> SparkAR is a software that Instragram uses to develop their popular face filters. 
                                Its a simple --- drag and connect --- type of creation. But crucial when the platforms are consistently trending and refreshing itself.
                                SparkAR is friendly to all types of ages above 12 and it doesn't get too complicated till code is required. 
                                But you can still create the most entertaining face filters, all is needed is creativity. 
                                Ontop here, are two videos created by DJS Create which I found friendly and simple enough to follow for a broad introduction of SparkAR!

        <p class="project-text-2">In Creative Technology --- like every other studio --- we follow the norms which AFH embodies. Be <span class="bold-letter"> respectful</span>. Be <span class="bold-letter">cooperative</span>. Be <span class="bold-letter">creative</span>. Be <span class="bold-letter">accepting</span>.
                                    Essentially, AFH is just one massive studio to really project your creativeness to test the limits of your capabilities. AFH is a place of opportunity. You focus on one studio of your choice. 
                                    Then you focus on that sole value of yourself. Which adds more value and worth to your identity to form interest from companies when a job is available. 
                                    As someone in the present moment, I've grown in this environment to a person of conscious, which comes with respect, awareness, responsibility and duty.
                                    Though, I may not be the best of myself right now --- AFH had put me on my feet on the path that was the best through cooperation and communication.</p>

            <p class="project-text-3">Being in AFH, I've accumulated a lot of HTML & CSS skills, which I was able to project towards some web development. 
            With the other 5 starting teens in Creative Technology at the time, we'd create websites either for client purposes or for practice; which we still do today.
            Coding wasn't very much of my expertise, nor was it ever in my vision of my future. But I would be lying if I argued that coding wasn't fun sometimes. 
            Just building websites and designing them was very much enjoyable as it kind of aligned with it being creative or artistic; which at the time, I was a decent artist myself.
            Websites --- either if it was simple or difficult --- are always manageable; I find it similar to solving puzzles as the process of coding is always trialed and solved through error. 
            These are some of the websites I've developed so far.</p>

            I mainly helped developed assets as I wasn't the best at Js, therefore I created many animated & non-animated assets toward our games.         </p>
