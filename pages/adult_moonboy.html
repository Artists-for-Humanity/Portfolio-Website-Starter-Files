        Soon enough though, Moon wouldn't be the only cat in the house, we found a mama cat with a litter of three and I ended up keeping one of the babies (once she was old enough of course). She was named "Roma" after my mom's former cat "Rom√°n".

    <div class="adult2">
        Though Moon didn't get along with the mama cat, Dolly, he immediately loved Roma. They were practically inseparable and you would never see one without the other. They were the cutest pair and I'd like to think she made him a softer, more gentle boy.
